## School Cars (school project - HEPL INPRES 2014-2015)

![build status](https://codeship.com/projects/57d384c0-6371-0132-f262-3244b18e1293/status?branch=master)

### Context

You develop an application for a company selling cars (more informations in the pdf)

The application is built with C++99 and presented on Solaris (should compile everywhere
- Linux requires python to create the target dir using `make clean` cause I'm lazy)

### License

Do what you want with that project, just remember that's a school project, I'm no C++ expert
and it might well be completly flawed.
